## About Me

 I am a Research Assistant at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, where I work with Dr. Sanju Sinha on computational pathology and aging biology. I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology. My research focuses on building computational frameworks to understand ovarian aging, integrating histopathology, transcriptomics, and machine learning. Broadly, I am interested in multimodal foundation models, tissue remodeling, and developing biomarkers that advance women’s health and reproductive longevity.
